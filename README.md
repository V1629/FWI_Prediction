# FWI_Prediction
FWI Prediction

Project Overview
This project focuses on Full-Waveform Inversion (FWI), a geophysical technique used to estimate subsurface properties from seismic data. The repository provides a comprehensive workflow, including data processing, model training, and deployment setup, aimed at predicting subsurface characteristics.

Features
Data Processing: Efficient preparation of seismic data for analysis.

Machine Learning Models: Implementation of machine learning techniques for FWI.

Visualization: Jupyter Notebooks for data visualization and model interpretation.

Deployment Ready: Configurations for deploying the application using AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
